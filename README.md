# Ninja Slashing Game

I inspired by a browser game called Dojo of Death. I really liked that game. Therefore i wanted to develop a game like it.

I wrote the codes and drawed the sprites(most of the sprites are placeholders). This was the first project that all of those things i made.

Example placeholder animation for running:
